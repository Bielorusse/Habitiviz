# Habitiviz

Habitiviz is a data visualization project based on p5.js, and using data fetched
automatically from my [Habitica](https://habitica.com) account.
The result is accessible at [thibautvoirand.com/habitiviz](https://thibautvoirand.com/habitiviz/)

It displays recent Habitica activities in a calendar, highlighting the most
productive days.

The result is now fixed at the end of 2022, because I stopped using Habitica in
2023.
